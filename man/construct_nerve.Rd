\title{Compute the nerve of the cover.}
\arguments{
\item{k}{The order of the simplices to construct. See details.}

\item{indices}{(n x k) matrix of indices of the covers index set to update.}

\item{min_weight}{minimum intersection size to consider as a simplex. Defaults to 1.}
}
\description{
Computes (or updates) the k-simplices composing the Mapper, where k >= 0.
}
\details{
Compared to \code{construct_k_skeleton}, this method \emph{only} intersections
between (k-1) simplices in the complex.

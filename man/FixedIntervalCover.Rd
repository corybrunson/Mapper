FixedIntervalCover
}
\description{
\code{\link{R6}} class representing a fixed interval cover.
}
\details{
The fixed interval cover is multidimensional, two-parameter family of covers. Given the number of
intervals and the overlap percentage between these intervals, this class constructs cover of the
given filter space, where the open sets represent a (generalized) collection of interval level sets, 
distributed uniformly in a grid-like fashion. Unlike the \code{\link{RestrainedIntervalCover}}, the open sets
are not constrained by range of the filter values. \cr 
\cr 
The mapper corresponding to this cover may be thought of as a relaxed Reeb graph.

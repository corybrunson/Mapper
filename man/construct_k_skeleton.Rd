\title{Constructs the k-skeleton}
\arguments{
\item{k}{the maximal dimension to consider.}
}
\description{
Computes the k-skeleton of the mapper by computing the nerve of the pullback of \code{cover} member.
}
\details{
The primary output of the Mapper method is a simplicial complex. With \code{\link{MapperRef}} objects,
the simplicial complex is stored as a \code{\link[simplextree]{simplextree}}. The underlying complex does not need to be modified by the user, i.e. is completely maintained by \code{\link{MapperRef}} methods
(e.g. this method, \code{\link{construct_nerve}}, etc.). \cr
\cr
This function computes the k-skeleton inductively, e.g. by first computing the vertices,
then the edges, etc. up to the dimension specified. A check is performed to ensure the pullback has been decomposed, and
if not, then \code{\link{construct_pullback}} is called. \cr
\cr
For an algorithmic description of this process, see Singh et. al, section 3.2.

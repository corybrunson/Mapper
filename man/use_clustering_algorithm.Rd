\title{Sets the clustering algorithm}
\arguments{
\item{cl}{Either one of the link criteria used in the \code{\link[stats]{hclust}} function (string) or a function. See details.}

\item{cutoff_method}{Type of heuristic to determine cut value. See details. Ignored is \code{cl} is a function.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed as defaults to the cutoff method. See details.}
}
\description{
Sets the clustering algorithm used to construct the connected components in the pullback cover.
}
\details{
If \code{cl} is a linkage criterion, a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm is used with suitable default parameters.
If it is a function, it must have a signature compatible with \code{function(pid, idx, self, ...)} where
\code{pid} is the index of the (pullback) set to cluster (see \code{CoverRef}),
\code{idx} are the indices of the points in \code{X} to cluster on, and
\code{self} is the \code{MapperRef} instance environment.
\cr
The cutoff method may be one of either c("continuous", "histogram"). See \code{\link{cutoff_first_bin}} and \code{\link{cutoff_first_threshold}}
for what they each correspond to, respectively. Additional named parameters passed via \code{...} act as defaults to the cutting method chosen.
If not chosen, reasonable defaults are used. \cr
\cr
Additional named parameters passed via the dots in \code{$clustering_algorithm}
will taken precedence and override all previously set default settings.

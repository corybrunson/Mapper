The `Mapper` package provides an [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
implementation of the *Mapper* framework (see [1](#mapper_paper)). The
package includes:

  - Efficient implementations of *Mapper* components using
    [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html)

  - Practical default parameters (filters, covers, etc.) for those
    unfamiliar with *Mapper*

  - Composability via [method
    chaining](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html#method-chaining)

  - Various options to plot, visualize, and interact with *mappers*

The package is designed to make modifying or extending the *Mapper*
method simple and efficient, without limiting its generality.

## Installation

Install the `Mapper` package from github as follows:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("peekxc/Mapper")
```

A CRAN release is planned for the future.

## Getting started

*Mapper* takes as input a point cloud \(X\) and a reference map
\(f : X \to Z\), and returns a topological summary of \(X\) expressed
via a cover equipped to the codomain of the map. For example, consider a
point cloud sampled from an ‘eight-curve’ in
\(\mathbb{R}^2\):

\[g(t) = [\cos(t), \sin(t)\cos(t)],\; t \in \Big(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, \frac{3}{2}\pi\Big)\]
In the example below, the data set \(X\) is created from equally spaced
samples over \(t\), and the map chosen is simply the \(x\)-coordinate of
the shape, i.e.
\(f(X) = Z = x_1\).

``` r
t <- seq(-0.5*pi, (3/2)*pi, length.out = 100) + runif(100, min=0.01, max = 0.02)
eight <- cbind(x1=cos(t), x2=sin(t)*cos(t))
f_x <- matrix(cos(t))

## View the data along with the mapping 
layout(matrix(1:2, nrow = 1))
plot(eight, pch = 20, col = bin_color(f_x), main = expression(X %subset% R^2))
stripchart(f_x, pch = "|", main = expression(f(X) %subset% R)) 
points(cbind(f_x, 1), pch = "|", col = bin_color(f_x), cex = 2)
```

<img src="man/figures/figure_eight.png" width=100% />

Below is a illustrative example of how one may go about constructing a
*mapper*.

``` r
m <- MapperRef$new()$
  use_data(data = eight)$
  use_filter(filter = f_x)$
  use_cover(cover = "fixed interval", number_intervals = 5, percent_overlap = 20)$
  use_clustering_algorithm(cl = "single")$
  construct_k_skeleton(k = 1L)
print(m)
#> Mapper construction with (7, 8) (0, 1)-simplices
#> Fixed Interval Cover: (number intervals = [5], percent overlap = [20]%)
```

There are multiple options one may use to visualize **mapper**. A
default plotting that colors nodes and edges on raindbow gradient is
available via the S3 `plot` override:

``` r
plot(m)
```

#### Customizing Mapper

Almost any component of the Mapper method can be customized.

Want to change the metric? Pass the name of any proximity measure used
in the [proxy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/proxy/index.html)
package.

``` r
## See ?proxy::pr_DB for more details.
m$use_distance_measure("manhattan") ## This is stored as m$measure
```

You can also pass an arbitrary ‘dist’ object:

``` r
x_dist <- dist(eight, method = "manhattan")
m$use_data(x_dist)
```

Prefer a different [linkage
criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Linkage_criteria)
to cluster with? Any of the criteria used by
[hclust](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/hclust.html)
can be swapped in.

``` r
m$use_clustering_algorithm(cl = "average")
```

Or, just replace the clustering algorithm entirely by supplying a
function.

``` r
## If using a custom metric, just compute the distance matrix 
## pid := open set index 
## idx := point indices in the preimage of the open set indexed by 'pid' 
## self := mapper instance object ('m' in this case)
m$use_clustering_algorithm(cl = function(pid, idx, self){
  dist_x <- self$distance_subset(idx)
  hc <- hclust(dist_x, method = "average")
  eps <- cutoff_first_threshold(hc)
  cutree(hc, h = eps)
})
```

If you prefer a different covering, just assign a valid object
inheriting from
`CoverRef`.

``` r
m$use_cover(cover="fixed interval", number_intervals = 10L, percent_overlap = 50)
```

A list of available covering methods, their correspondings parameters,
and their generators can be printed as follows:

``` r
covers_available()
#> Typename:                    Generator:                         Parameters:                          
#>  fixed interval               FixedIntervalCover                 number_intervals, percent_overlap
#>  restrained interval          RestrainedIntervalCover            number_intervals, percent_overlap
#>  ball                         BallCover                          epsilon
```

Alternatively, you can create your own cover. See the article on [how to
make custom
cover](articles/UsingCustomCover.html).

<!-- The cover is composed of subsets of the data indexed by an __index set__ -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- print(m$cover$index_set) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- These indices naturally act as keys into the collection of sets comprising the cover -->

<!-- These indices can be used as keys into the collection of sets comprising the cover.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- all(m$cover$index_set %in% names(m$cover$level_sets)) -->

<!-- ``` -->

Prior to constructing the simplicial complex, *Mapper* requires applying
the *pullback* operation. Computationally, the pullback applies the
clustering algorithm to subsets of the data given by the cover, which
decomposes the data set into connected components. In Mapper, these
connected components are represented as vertices. To view which vertices
are mapped from the sets in the cover, use the `pullback` member:

``` r
m$construct_pullback()
str(m$pullback)
#> List of 10
#>  $ (1) : num 0
#>  $ (2) : num [1:2] 1 2
#>  $ (3) : num [1:2] 3 4
#>  $ (4) : num 5
#>  $ (5) : num 6
#>  $ (6) : num 7
#>  $ (7) : num 8
#>  $ (8) : num [1:2] 9 10
#>  $ (9) : num [1:2] 11 12
#>  $ (10): num 13
```

The vertices are stored are stored as a named list. Each vertex contains
a vector of the indices that representing the points that comprise the
connected component.

``` r
sapply(m$vertices, length)
#>  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 
#> 25  9  9  7  7 14 15 13 12  7  7 10 10 26
```

Once you’re satisfied with the clustering, you can construct the nerve,
the principal output of *Mapper*. The complex is stored in a [Simplex
Tree](?simplex_tree) (see 2), which available via the
`$simplicial_complex` member. Initially, the complex is empty:

``` r
m$simplicial_complex
#> < empty simplex tree >
```

The maximum dimension of the nerve is up to you. It’s common restrict
the *mapper* to \(1\)-skeleton.

``` r
m$construct_nerve(k = 0L)
print(m$simplicial_complex)
#> Simplex Tree with (14) (0)-simplices
m$construct_nerve(k = 1L)
print(m$simplicial_complex)
#> Simplex Tree with (14, 15) (0, 1)-simplices
plot(m$simplicial_complex)
```

![](index_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

By default, the `construct...` series of functions enact side-effects
and return the instance invisibly, making them suitable to chain. If you
want to inspect the result before modifying the instance, pass
`modify=FALSE`. For example, to list the vertices that have a non-empty
intersection (edges that would appear in the 1-skeleton):

``` r
do.call(rbind, m$construct_nerve(k = 1L, modify = FALSE))
#>       [,1] [,2]
#>  [1,]    0    1
#>  [2,]    0    2
#>  [3,]    1    3
#>  [4,]    2    4
#>  [5,]    3    5
#>  [6,]    4    5
#>  [7,]    5    6
#>  [8,]    6    7
#>  [9,]    7    8
#> [10,]    8    9
#> [11,]    8   10
#> [12,]    9   11
#> [13,]   10   12
#> [14,]   11   13
#> [15,]   12   13
```

The \(1\)-skeleton can be exported to any of the usual graph-type data
structures.

``` r
m$simplicial_complex$as_adjacency_matrix()
m$simplicial_complex$as_adjacency_list()
m$simplicial_complex$as_edge_list()
```

### Visualizing the **mapper**

To get a quick overview of what the **mapper** looks like, you can use
the default S3 `plot` method, which by default uses the underlying
[simplextree package](https://github.com/peekxc/simplextree) to plot the
complex with sufficient color and size defaults.

``` r
plot(m)
```

<img src="index_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="100%" />

Alternatively, the \(1\)-skeleton can be automatically converted to
[igraph](https://igraph.org/r/) objects and customized as
needed.

``` r
plot(m$as_igraph(), vertex.label=NA)
```

<img src="index_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="100%" />

<!-- One of the standard way of visualizing __mappers__ is to size the vertices logarithmically according to how many points they have in them and colored based on the mean value of the points $f$ values. Each vertex is given a label of the form "x:y" where 'x' denotes the vertex id, and 'y' denotes the number of points in the vertex.   -->

For more interactive visualization options, consider the (experimental)
[pixiplex](https://github.com/peekxc/pixiplex) package.

``` r
## Install with devtools::install_github("peekxc/pixiplex")
library("pixiplex")
plot(m$as_pixiplex()) %>% enableForce()
```
